import smart_canteen.sql on mysql<br>
inside htdocs create a folder named scps1 and put all files there
<br>
download composer from here"https://getcomposer.org/download/"<br>
when downloading select for me only instead for all users to avoid problems
<br>
open php.ini file from apache config dropdown<br>
search for  <br>;extension=gd
<br>;extension=zip <br> and remove ; from both lines
<br>(added vendor folder no need to install composer but still need to remoce ; to activate both of them)
